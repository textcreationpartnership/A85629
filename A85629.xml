            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On Thur≈øday the 8.th of this pre≈øent May, we marched from our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters neer Blanford towards Taunton, but the ≈øouldiers being incouraged by our Officers, were ≈øo earne≈øt upon their march, (though many of then had ≈øcarce ≈øhooes with any ≈øoales for them to tread upon) for the reliefe of poore Taunton, that they were ready to advance early in the morning, and having ≈øome additionall forces to come from the Countrey, ≈øo doubled the courage of our men, expre≈ø≈øing great joy at the hearing of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; wee quartered that night between Birdport and Bemi≈øter, our ≈øtrength being then in all about 6000. Hor≈øe and Foot, we called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell of Warre about ordering our bu≈øine≈ø≈øe in falling upon the enemy, being re≈øolved if they ≈øtayed till we came up, to fight with them, ≈øome di≈øputes there was whether Col. <hi>Graves</hi> commands of the hor≈øe, or Col. <hi>Welden</hi> of foot ≈øhould have the guide of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, ≈øome delivered their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions for the one, ≈øome for the other, but laying all ≈øelf-ends a≈øide, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing re≈øolved that the worke ≈øhould not be neglected not regarding who had precedency, ≈øo it was effected, the next morning early they were again upon their march.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 9.th of May, we marched by Pelli≈øden Pen, and Bur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oeke, and ≈øo on towards Chard, which is about 10. miles from Taunton, where we had an intent to quarter that night, and about 3. or 4. houres before night after that we had pa≈ø≈øed Ford, and were come over the bridge, and ≈øo upon our march, never di≈øovering one Scout of theirs all the way, untill we came neere Winchan in Kingsbury Hundred within 3. miles of Chard, where we received notice that the enemy were ≈øtill before Taunton, and that the town was much ≈øtraitened by them, and in great danger to be lo≈øt, if we did not ≈øpeedily relieve them; ≈øo we marched on, and quartered at Chard that night, no enemy all this while appearing to us.</p>
            <p>On Saturday May the 10:th the enemy faced us with a ≈ømall party of hor≈øe, not above 300. in ≈øight, others between them and Taunton, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting what they could to hinder our going on, we drew out upon them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112988:3"/>and made them to retreat, but by rea≈øon of the Inlands they by con≈øtant oppo≈øition, did ≈øo trouble us that they hoped to out-vapour our intents, but were deceived; we drove them back by ≈øeverall charges upon them, all the way between Chard and Petmi≈øter, which is about 3. miles ≈øhort of Taunton in the way of Wellington, on our march by parties charging each other, there were ≈øix pri≈øoners taken, and one killed of the enemies partie; and foure pri≈øoners taken, and one killed on our partie. The enemy continued facing of us ≈øtill, and the ≈øiege was continued before Taunton, (as wee under≈øtood afterwards) but we went ≈øtill on, following, and driving them back, till w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> came betweene Trull and Orchard, within a mile of Taunton, and there we ≈øhot off a warning-peece, to give them notice in the towne of our being there: but (it ≈øeemes they had but little ≈øtore of powder in the towne, for) there was no an≈øwer made to us. but night being come, we could not go any further with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger: and therefore bettook our ≈øelves to our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ≈øetting a ≈øtrong watch about us; and indeed wee re≈øted but little that night; for all the Army generally thought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> long till morning came, that they might be upon their work, all being re≈øolved to force the enemy to ri≈øe, or to fight with them. And then making inquiry into the ≈øtate of the enemy, and what had been done that day, as al≈øo inquiring into their ≈øtrength, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øing how to manage the next dayes bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. There was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto us by tho≈øe that we had taken pri≈øoners, that they were confident that we would not have been ≈øo ≈øoon with them; but tooke our Army to be their friends, and that ours was <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> Army that was come up to ≈øtrengthen them, they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring why wee fought with them; ≈øo for that night wee re≈øted in our quarters at Pitmi≈øter, Pounsford, and Trull, intending the next morning to fall upon the enemy, who (as wee heard) were about foure or five thou≈øand.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:112988:4"/>
            <p>On the next morning (which was the Lords Day, May it.) we drew our ≈øelves into a po≈øture to fight with the Enemy; but the enemy had ≈øo blocked up the way with trees, timber, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther combu≈øtible matter, that we could not pa≈ø≈øe; ≈øo that we were faine to make our way, which we did with what ≈øpeed could be; and when we came before the towne, the enemy was gone; and therefore in the next place I ≈øhall certifie you further certifie you what is declared to me concerning the proceedings of the enemy before the towne, and how they now marched off from thence.</p>
            <p>The enemy have made many a≈ø≈øaults upon the town, and have been gallantly repul≈øed: Colonell Blake the Gouernour, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Officers, with the ≈øouldiers, having (during all the ≈øiege) ≈øhewed ≈øo much gallantry in the defence thereof, that they were re≈øolved to fight it out in the defence of that place, while they had any power left to defend them≈øelves withall.</p>
            <p>On Thur≈øday the eight of this pre≈øent May the enemy had ≈øtormed the town with great violence, but were gallantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and divers were hurt and killed on both ≈øides: and although the town was in ≈øo great di≈øtre≈ø≈øe (and the enemy had taken a hou≈øe from them which commanded one of their Works) and that they were not certaine of ≈øpeedy reliefe, yet (tru≈øting in God) they were re≈øolved ≈øtill to ≈øtand out, notwith≈øtanding the enemy played hard upon them.</p>
            <p>On Friday the enemy very de≈øperately ≈øtormed the towne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and were againe as valiantly repul≈øed from the Garri≈øon, to the great lo≈ø≈øe of the enemy. That which Colonell <hi>Blake</hi> mo≈øt wanted in the town (be≈øides hor≈øe-meat) was match, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were forced to burne their bed-cords in ≈øtead of it. And they began to be ≈øtraitened of powder; they played upon them all this day, and got ≈øo clo≈øe up to the towne, that they burne 20 hou≈øes; but could do no good of it for all that: the towne ≈øtill held out, and oppo≈øed them.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:112988:4"/>
            <p>On Saturday the enemy was not ≈øo furious, yet made ≈øome ≈øhot again≈øt the towne againe; it is conceived that they ≈øtayed in expectation of <hi>Gorings</hi> coming up to them; and that by their owne Scouts mi≈øtaking, they took our Army for <hi>Gorings,</hi> as it ≈øeemes they did when they met them at Chard; and ≈øo lay ≈øtill till <hi>Goring</hi> came to them.</p>
            <p>On the Lords day they did not much trouble the towne, by rea≈øon of our mens coming upon them, which found them work enough for that day: and in the night the enemy drew off their Cannon, and rai≈øed the ≈øiege, taking the opportunitie of the night to fly by; and they divided them≈øelves ≈øeverall wayes, one part went towards Wellington, in the way to Exeter, and the other towards Bridgewater, marching away very di≈øorderly, we have made ≈øome charges upon ≈øeverall parties in their Reare, and killed and taken ≈øome: but by rea≈øon of the in-land coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and mo≈øt of all for the great need that Taunton ≈øtands in of pre≈øent releefe; as al≈øo, for that the Souldiers have marched them≈øelves almo≈øt off of their legs, they could not without great prejudice (many wayes) de≈øert the carrying in of releefe ≈øpeedily into Taunton, to follow the enemy. It is beleeved, that the enemy will be ≈øuddenly on our skirts, and ≈øhould the≈øe Forces be drawne away, they would ≈øoone lay ≈øiege before the towne againe, e≈øpecially when <hi>Goring</hi> is come up to them.</p>
            <p>There are in Taunton about 200 wounded men, and about 50 (I heare) have been ≈ølaine during this ≈øiege: Colonell <hi>Blake</hi> is very well, and there hath not many Officers been lo≈øt: what the particulars are of the enemies lo≈ø≈øes, wee cannot certainly learne for the pre≈øent; but there is much lamentation on their part, for the lo≈ø≈øe of divers gallant men, that were of the Kings be≈øt Souldiers; they have had many Colonels, Majors, and Captaines, and other Officers of note, at the lea≈øt 20 ≈ølaine: and it is beleeved, that at lea≈øt two or three hundred men have beene
